# EP SHACL rules

This package contains the SHACL rules for the 4 first converted datasets.
The rules are organized in one subdirectory for each dataset.


Each subdirectory has the same structure and contains the following files :

- DatasetX_abc.xlsx : Level 1 SHACL rules for this Dataset, written in an Excel table
- DatasetX_abc.ttl : Level 1 SHACL rules for this Dataset in Turtle, converted from the Excel file using the converter at https://skos-play.sparna.fr/play/convert
- DatasetX_abc.png : Diagram of the Level 1 rules for this Dataset, generated from the Turtle file using the online drawing tool at https://shacl-play.sparna.fr/play/draw
- DatasetX_abc.html : Documentation page of the Level 1 rules for this Dataset, generated from the Turtle file using the online documentation generator at https://shacl-play.sparna.fr/play/doc
- report
	- report/report.html : Validation Report in HTML generated by validating the content of the Dataset against the Level 1 rules (DatasetX_abc.ttl), using the online validation tool at https://shacl-play.sparna.fr/play/validate
- business-rules
	- business-rules/business-rule-X :
		- business-rules/business-rule-X/business-rule.ttl : a business rule encoded in SHACL. The description of the rule is inside this file, in a "skos:definition" property around line 23
		- business-rules/business-rule-X/input : the test data against which the business rule is run to produce the validation report. The data is the _unmodified_ data, as it was converted during the first phase. Sometimes a rule is executed against more than one dataset.
		- business-rules/business-rule-X/report.html : the validation report in HTML generated by validating the business rule against the inpt data, using the online validation tool at https://shacl-play.sparna.fr/play/validate
		- business-rules/business-rule-X/report.ttl : raw validation report, in machine-readable format, that contains the raw information diplayed in the HTML validation report
		- business-rules/business-rule-X/report-raw.html : a different display of the validation report, using a table structure
